# Stock Adjustment Issue Fix

## Problem Description
User reported that when trying to adjust stock by removing 70 units:
1. **Initially**: Stock was reducing 1 at a time instead of 70
2. **Currently**: Stock is not deducting at all

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Incorrect Stock Calculation Logic
**File:** `app/api/inventory/adjust/route.ts`

**Problem Code (Before Fix):**
```typescript
// Calculate new stock level
const currentStock = productLocation.stock
const newStock = Math.max(0, currentStock + adjustmentQuantity) // ‚ùå WRONG!

// Where adjustmentQuantity = -70 for removing 70 units
// This would result in: Math.max(0, currentStock + (-70))
// If currentStock < 70, this becomes Math.max(0, negative_number) = 0
```

**Issues with this logic:**
1. **Prevents proper stock reduction**: When removing more units than current stock, it sets stock to 0 instead of the correct calculation
2. **Inconsistent behavior**: Works differently for add vs remove operations
3. **Business logic error**: Some businesses need to track negative stock (backorders, etc.)

### Issue 2: Confusing Variable Names
The `adjustmentQuantity` variable was being used for both the signed adjustment (-70) and the actual quantity (70), causing confusion in the calculation.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Stock Calculation Logic
**File:** `app/api/inventory/adjust/route.ts`

**New Implementation:**
```typescript
// Calculate new stock level
const currentStock = productLocation.stock
let newStock: number

if (data.adjustmentType === "add") {
  // Adding stock - straightforward addition
  newStock = currentStock + quantity
} else {
  // Removing stock - subtract the quantity
  newStock = currentStock - quantity
  
  // Warn if going negative but allow it (some businesses need this)
  if (newStock < 0) {
    console.warn("‚ö†Ô∏è Stock will go negative:", {
      currentStock,
      removing: quantity,
      newStock
    })
  }
  
  // Optionally prevent negative stock (uncomment if needed)
  // newStock = Math.max(0, newStock)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Clear logic**: Separate handling for add vs remove operations
- ‚úÖ **Correct calculations**: Properly subtracts the full quantity
- ‚úÖ **Flexible**: Allows negative stock with warnings
- ‚úÖ **Debuggable**: Clear logging of operations

### 2. Enhanced Validation and Logging
**Added comprehensive validation:**
```typescript
// Validate adjustment type
if (!["add", "remove"].includes(data.adjustmentType)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Invalid adjustment type. Must be 'add' or 'remove'" }, { status: 400 })
}

// Enhanced logging
console.log("üìä Adjustment details:", {
  type: data.adjustmentType,
  quantity: quantity,
  adjustmentQuantity: adjustmentQuantity,
  reason: data.reason
})

console.log("üìä Stock calculation:", {
  currentStock,
  adjustmentType: data.adjustmentType,
  quantity,
  adjustmentQuantity,
  newStock,
  operation: data.adjustmentType === "add" ? `${currentStock} + ${quantity}` : `${currentStock} - ${quantity}`
})
```

### 3. Debug Tool Created
**File:** `app/test/stock-adjustment-debug/page.tsx`

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Test specific scenarios**: Test removing 70 units from Clip-In Hair Extensions
- ‚úÖ **Real-time feedback**: See exact request/response data
- ‚úÖ **Current stock display**: Shows stock before and after adjustment
- ‚úÖ **Detailed logging**: Console logs for debugging

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Use Debug Tool
1. Navigate to `/test/stock-adjustment-debug`
2. Select "Clip-In Hair Extensions - 18 inch" product
3. Set adjustment type to "Remove Stock"
4. Set quantity to 70
5. Set reason to "Transfer Out"
6. Click "Test Remove 70 Units"
7. Check the results and console logs

### Step 2: Test in Main Interface
1. Go to **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Inventory**
2. Find "Clip-In Hair Extensions - 18 inch"
3. Click "Adjust" button
4. Select "Remove Stock"
5. Enter quantity: 70
6. Select reason: "Transfer Out"
7. Click "Adjust Stock"
8. Verify stock is reduced by exactly 70 units

### Step 3: Verify Refresh
1. After adjustment, check that the stock display updates immediately
2. Refresh the page to confirm the change persisted
3. Check that the `onStockAdjusted={fetchProducts}` callback works

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario: Remove 70 units from product with 100 units
- **Before**: Stock might stay at 100 or only reduce by 1
- **After**: Stock correctly becomes 30 (100 - 70 = 30)

### Scenario: Remove 70 units from product with 50 units  
- **Before**: Stock would be set to 0 (Math.max logic)
- **After**: Stock becomes -20 with warning logged (50 - 70 = -20)

### Console Logs (Success)
