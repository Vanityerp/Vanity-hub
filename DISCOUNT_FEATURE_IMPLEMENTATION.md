## Technical Implementation Details

### Discount Calculation Logic
```typescript
const discountPercent = parseFloat(discountPercentage) || 0
const discountAmount = (total * discountPercent) / 100
const finalTotal = total - discountAmount
```

### Validation
- Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100
- Input validation prevents invalid values
- Error messages displayed for invalid inputs

### Transaction Recording
- Original amount preserved in metadata
- Discount percentage and amount recorded
- Final amount used for actual transaction value
- Backward compatibility maintained

## UI/UX Features

### PaymentDialog
- Discount section with gray background for visual separation
- Percentage input with clear labeling
- Real-time calculation display
- Error message display for validation

### POS Cart
- Integrated discount input in cart footer
- Visual breakdown showing original total, discount, and final total
- Consistent styling with existing cart design

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing payment flows continue to work without modification
- Discount parameters are optional in all function signatures
- Default behavior unchanged when no discount is applied

## Rollback Instructions
To revert these changes:
1. Restore the original versions of the 4 modified files
2. Remove the discount-related imports (Label in POS page)
3. No database changes were made, so no schema rollback needed

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test discount functionality with all payment methods (card, cash, mobile, gift card)
2. Verify discount validation (0-100% range)
3. Test real-time calculation updates
4. Verify transaction recording includes discount information
5. Test both PaymentDialog and POS cart discount features
6. Ensure existing payment flows work without discount
7. Test appointment payment with discount in calendar view
8. Verify booking summary reflects discount information correctly
