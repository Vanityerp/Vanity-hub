# Client Portal Appointments Display Fix

## Issue
Client portal appointment bookings were not being properly reflected in:
1. Accounting page source column (should show "Client Portal")
2. Daily sales tab appointments section

## Root Cause
The client portal appointment booking API was not properly marking appointments with the necessary metadata to identify them as client portal bookings, which prevented the transaction system from correctly setting the transaction source.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Client Portal Appointment Creation
**File Modified:** `app/api/client-portal/appointments/route.ts`

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// Added proper client portal identification fields
const newAppointment = {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Mark this appointment as coming from client portal
  source: 'client_portal',
  bookedVia: 'client_portal',
  metadata: {
    source: 'client_portal',
    bookedVia: 'client_portal',
    isClientPortalBooking: true
  },
  
  // ... rest of fields ...
};
```

### 2. Transaction Source Detection
**File:** `lib/consolidated-transaction-service.ts` (Already Working)

The consolidated transaction service already has logic to detect client portal appointments:

```typescript
// Check if this is a client portal appointment
if (appointment.source === 'client_portal' || 
    appointment.reference?.type === 'client_portal_order' ||
    appointment.metadata?.source === 'client_portal' ||
    appointment.bookedVia === 'client_portal') {
  transactionSource = TransactionSource.CLIENT_PORTAL;
}
```

### 3. Source Label Display
**File:** `lib/transaction-types.ts` (Already Working)

The transaction types already properly define the client portal label:

```typescript
case TransactionSource.CLIENT_PORTAL:
  return "Client Portal"
```

### 4. Daily Sales Appointments Section
**File:** `components/accounting/daily-sales.tsx` (Already Working)

The daily sales component already filters and displays appointment transactions:

```typescript
{dailyTransactions
  .filter(tx => tx.reference?.type === 'appointment')
  .map((tx, index) => (
    // Display appointment transaction
  ))}
```

## How It Works

### Client Portal Booking Flow:
1. **User books appointment** via client portal
2. **API creates appointment** with `source: 'client_portal'` and proper metadata
3. **Appointment completion** triggers transaction creation
4. **Consolidated transaction service** detects client portal source
5. **Transaction created** with `source: TransactionSource.CLIENT_PORTAL`
6. **Accounting page** displays "Client Portal" in source column
7. **Daily sales** shows appointment in appointments section

### Key Fields for Detection:
- `appointment.source === 'client_portal'`
- `appointment.bookedVia === 'client_portal'`
- `appointment.metadata.source === 'client_portal'`
- `appointment.metadata.isClientPortalBooking === true`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Accounting Page Source Column:
1. Navigate to Accounting → Transactions
2. Look for transactions with "Client Portal" in the Source column
3. These should be appointments booked via client portal

### 2. Check Daily Sales Appointments Section:
1. Navigate to Accounting → Daily Sales
2. Click on "Appointments" section
3. Client portal appointments should appear in the list
4. Source should be identifiable as client portal

### 3. Test Client Portal Booking:
1. Book an appointment via client portal
2. Complete the appointment (mark as completed)
3. Check accounting page - transaction should show "Client Portal" source
4. Check daily sales - appointment should appear in appointments section

## Files Modified

### Primary Fix:
- `app/api/client-portal/appointments/route.ts` - Added client portal identification fields

### Supporting Files (Already Working):
- `lib/consolidated-transaction-service.ts` - Transaction source detection
- `lib/transaction-types.ts` - Source label definitions
- `components/accounting/transactions.tsx` - Source display
- `components/accounting/daily-sales.tsx` - Appointments section

## Testing Script
**File:** `fix-client-portal-appointments.js`

This script provides:
- Verification of current state
- Sample transaction creation for testing
- Validation of source labels
- Complete fix execution

### Usage:
```javascript
// Run complete fix
window.fixClientPortalAppointments()

// Create test transaction
window.createSampleClientPortalAppointment()

// Check current state
window.verifyDailySalesAppointments()
```

## Expected Results

### Before Fix:
