## Visual Design Enhancements

- **Responsive design** maintaining consistency across all screen sizes

## Data Flow

### Transaction Recording
1. **Original amount** stored in `metadata.originalTotal`
2. **Final discounted amount** stored in main `amount` field
3. **Discount information** stored in metadata:
   - `discountApplied: true`
   - `discountPercentage: number`
   - `discountAmount: number`

### Display Logic
1. **Accounting aggregations** automatically use final amounts (correct behavior)
2. **Visual displays** show both original and final amounts for transparency
3. **Statistics calculations** derive discount amounts from metadata

## Technical Implementation

### Discount Detection
```typescript
transaction.metadata?.discountApplied && transaction.metadata?.originalTotal
```

### Amount Calculation
```typescript
const discountAmount = originalAmount - transaction.amount
```

### Statistics Aggregation
```typescript
const totalDiscountAmount = discountedTransactions.reduce((sum, tx) => {
  const originalTotal = tx.metadata?.originalTotal || 0
  const discountAmount = originalTotal - tx.amount
  return sum + discountAmount
}, 0)
```
