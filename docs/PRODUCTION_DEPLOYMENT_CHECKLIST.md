```bash
# Run this command to apply database changes
npx prisma db push
# or
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

### âœ… Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set `ALLOW_NEGATIVE_STOCK` environment variable (default: false)
- [ ] Verify database connection strings are correct
- [ ] Ensure all required API keys are configured
- [ ] Test environment variables in staging

```env
# Add to .env file
ALLOW_NEGATIVE_STOCK=false  # Set to true only if business requires negative stock
```

### âœ… Code Deployment
- [ ] Deploy updated inventory adjustment API (`app/api/inventory/adjust/route.ts`)
- [ ] Deploy enhanced checkout process (`app/client-portal/shop/checkout/page.tsx`)
