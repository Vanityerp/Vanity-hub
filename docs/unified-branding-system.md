# Unified Branding System Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a unified branding system that resolves inconsistent logo usage across the application and provides centralized brand management.

## Problem Solved

### Before Implementation
- **Inconsistent Company Names**: "SalonHub", "Vanity", "Vanity Hub" used across different pages
- **Different Logo Sources**: External blob storage URLs vs. text-based fallbacks
- **Hardcoded Branding**: Each component managed its own logo/branding
- **No Central Management**: No way to update branding across the application

### After Implementation
- **Single Source of Truth**: All branding managed through settings
- **Consistent Logos**: Unified Logo component used everywhere
- **Easy Management**: Upload and configure branding through settings UI
- **Automatic Updates**: Changes propagate across all pages instantly

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Logo Component (`components/ui/logo.tsx`)

**Features:**
- **Size Variants**: `sm`, `md`, `lg` for different use cases
- **Conditional Name Display**: Show/hide company name alongside logo
- **Clickable Links**: Optional href for navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Fallback Logic**: Default design when no custom logo uploaded
- **Theme Support**: Inverted colors for dark backgrounds

**Convenience Components:**
- `DashboardLogo`: Pre-configured for dashboard header
- `ClientPortalLogo`: Pre-configured for client portal
- `LoginLogo`: Pre-configured for login page
- `FooterLogo`: Pre-configured for footer usage

### 2. Branding Settings Component (`components/settings/branding-settings.tsx`)

**Features:**
- **File Upload**: Support for PNG, JPG, SVG formats
- **File Validation**: Size limits (5MB) and type checking
- **Live Preview**: See how branding appears across different contexts
- **Color Picker**: Primary brand color selection
- **Company Name Management**: Centralized name configuration
- **Logo Alt Text**: Accessibility support

**Preview Sections:**
- Dashboard header preview
- Login page preview
- Small size navigation preview

### 3. Enhanced Settings Storage (`lib/settings-storage.ts`)

**New Interface:**
```typescript
interface BrandingSettings {
  companyLogo: string | null;
  companyName: string;
  primaryBrandColor: string;
  logoAltText: string;
  showCompanyNameWithLogo: boolean;
}
```

**Default Values:**
- Company Name: "Vanity Hub"
- Primary Color: "#8b5cf6" (Purple)
- Logo: null (uses fallback)
- Show Name: true

## Pages Updated

### 1. Dashboard Layout (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`)
- **Before**: Hardcoded external image URL + "SalonHub" text
- **After**: `DashboardLogo` component with role-based navigation

### 2. Login Page (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: Text-based "V" logo + "Vanity" text
- **After**: `LoginLogo` component with consistent branding

### 3. Booking Page (`app/booking/page.tsx`)
- **Before**: External image URL + "SalonHub" text in header and footer
- **After**: `Logo` and `FooterLogo` components

### 4. Client Portal Header (`components/client-portal/client-portal-header.tsx`)
- **Before**: Business name first letter in pink circle
- **After**: `ClientPortalLogo` with responsive design

### 5. Client Portal Layout (`app/client-portal/layout.tsx`)
- **Before**: Hardcoded "V" in pink circle + "Vanity Hub"
- **After**: `ClientPortalLogo` and `FooterLogo` components

### 6. Settings Page (`app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`)
- **Added**: New "Branding" tab with `BrandingSettings` component

## Technical Implementation

### Logo Component Architecture

```typescript
interface LogoProps {
  size?: "sm" | "md" | "lg";
  showName?: boolean;
  href?: string;
  className?: string;
  inverted?: boolean;
  companyNameOverride?: string;
}
```

### Fallback Logic
When no custom logo is uploaded:
1. Creates gradient background using primary brand color
2. Shows first letter of company name
3. Maintains consistent sizing and styling

### File Upload System
- **Client-side validation**: File type and size checking
- **Preview generation**: Blob URLs for immediate preview
- **Error handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Storage**: Currently uses blob URLs (ready for server integration)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Logo Usage
```tsx
import { Logo } from "@/components/ui/logo"

// Simple logo
<Logo />

// Logo with custom size and link
<Logo size="lg" href="/dashboard" />

// Logo without company name
<Logo showName={false} />
```

### Convenience Components
```tsx
import { DashboardLogo, ClientPortalLogo, LoginLogo } from "@/components/ui/logo"

// Pre-configured components
<DashboardLogo />
<ClientPortalLogo />
<LoginLogo />
```

### Settings Integration
```tsx
import { BrandingSettings } from "@/components/settings/branding-settings"

// In settings page
<BrandingSettings />
```

## Benefits

### For Administrators
- **Easy Branding Updates**: Upload logo once, updates everywhere
- **Consistent Brand Identity**: Unified appearance across all pages
- **Professional Appearance**: Custom logos instead of text fallbacks
- **Color Coordination**: Primary brand color integration

### For Developers

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Server-side File Storage**: Replace blob URLs with proper file storage
2. **Multiple Logo Variants**: Light/dark theme logos
3. **Brand Guidelines**: Color palette management
4. **Logo History**: Version control for uploaded logos
5. **Bulk Export**: Download all brand assets

### Integration Opportunities
