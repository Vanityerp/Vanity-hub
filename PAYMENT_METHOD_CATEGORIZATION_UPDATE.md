# Payment Method Categorization Update

## Overview
Updated the cash movement summary section in the daily sales tab of the accounting page to improve payment method categorization and tracking by replacing the generic "Other" category with more specific categories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Daily Sales Component (`components/accounting/daily-sales.tsx`)

#### Updated Payment Type Categories
**Before:**
```typescript
const standardPaymentTypes = [
  "Cash",
  "Other",
  "Gift card redemptions",
  "Payments collected",
  "Of which tips"
]
```

**After:**
```typescript
const standardPaymentTypes = [
  "Cash",
  "Card Payment",
  "Mobile Payment",
  "Gift card redemptions",
  "Payments collected",
  "Of which tips"
]
```

#### Enhanced Payment Method Categorization Logic
**Before:**
- All card payments, bank transfers, and mobile payments were categorized as "Other"

**After:**
- **Card Payment**: Credit cards, bank transfers, checks, and legacy "other" payments
- **Mobile Payment**: Mobile payments and loyalty points (app-based)
- **Cash**: Cash payments (unchanged)
- **Gift card redemptions**: Gift card payments (unchanged)

#### Detailed Mapping:
```typescript
switch (tx.paymentMethod) {
  case PaymentMethod.CASH:
    paymentType = "Cash"
    break
  case PaymentMethod.CREDIT_CARD:
  case PaymentMethod.BANK_TRANSFER:
  case PaymentMethod.CHECK:
    paymentType = "Card Payment"
    break
  case PaymentMethod.MOBILE_PAYMENT:
    paymentType = "Mobile Payment"
    break
  case PaymentMethod.GIFT_CARD:
    paymentType = "Gift card redemptions"
    break
  case PaymentMethod.LOYALTY_POINTS:
    paymentType = "Mobile Payment" // App-based payments
    break
  case PaymentMethod.OTHER:
    paymentType = "Card Payment" // Migrate existing "Other" to Card Payment
    break
  default:
    paymentType = "Card Payment" // Default fallback
}
```

### 2. Reports Page (`app/dashboard/reports/page.tsx`)

#### Updated Payment Method Breakdown
**Before:**
```typescript
paymentMethodBreakdown: {
  creditCard: 0,
  cash: 0,
  mobilePayment: 0,
  other: 0
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
paymentMethodBreakdown: {
  creditCard: 0,
  cash: 0,
  mobilePayment: 0,
  cardPayment: 0 // Renamed from 'other'
}
```

#### Enhanced Calculation Logic
```typescript
const paymentMethodBreakdown = {
  creditCard: filteredTxs.filter(t => t.paymentMethod === 'credit_card').reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0),
  cash: filteredTxs.filter(t => t.paymentMethod === 'cash').reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0),
  mobilePayment: filteredTxs.filter(t => ['mobile_payment', 'loyalty_points'].includes(t.paymentMethod)).reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0),
  cardPayment: filteredTxs.filter(t => ['bank_transfer', 'check', 'other'].includes(t.paymentMethod)).reduce((sum, t) => sum + t.amount, 0)
}
```

## Payment Method Categories

### Card Payment
- **Credit Card** (`credit_card`)
- **Bank Transfer** (`bank_transfer`)
- **Check** (`check`)
- **Other** (`other`) - Legacy payments migrated to this category

### Mobile Payment
- **Mobile Payment** (`mobile_payment`) - Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay, QR codes
- **Loyalty Points** (`loyalty_points`) - App-based loyalty redemptions

### Existing Categories (Unchanged)
- **Cash** (`cash`)
- **Gift Card Redemptions** (`gift_card`)
