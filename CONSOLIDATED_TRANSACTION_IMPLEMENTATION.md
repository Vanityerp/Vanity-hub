# Consolidated Transaction Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented consolidated payment records for the VanityERP accounting system. The system now generates only one transaction ID per payment session, combining both services and products into a single transaction record while maintaining the discount logic that applies only to services.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Transaction Types and Interfaces
- **File**: `lib/transaction-types.ts`
- Added `CONSOLIDATED_SALE` transaction type
- Enhanced `TransactionItem` interface with:
  - `type: 'service' | 'product'` field
  - Discount-related fields (`discountApplied`, `discountPercentage`, `discountAmount`, `originalPrice`)
- Enhanced `Transaction` interface with consolidated fields:
  - `serviceAmount`, `productAmount`, `originalServiceAmount`
  - `discountPercentage`, `discountAmount`

### 2. Created Consolidated Transaction Service
- **File**: `lib/consolidated-transaction-service.ts`
- New service class `ConsolidatedTransactionService` with methods:
  - `generateTransactionId()`: Creates unique transaction IDs with "TX-CONS-" prefix
  - `createConsolidatedTransaction()`: Creates consolidated transactions from appointment data
  - `createConsolidatedTransactionFromBooking()`: Creates consolidated transactions from booking data
- Handles discount application logic (services only)
- Determines appropriate transaction type based on items

### 3. Updated Database Schema
- **File**: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added new fields to Transaction model:
  - `serviceAmount`, `productAmount`, `originalServiceAmount`
  - `discountPercentage`, `discountAmount`
  - `items` (JSON field for storing transaction items)

### 4. Modified Payment Dialog Transaction Recording
- **File**: `components/scheduling/enhanced-appointment-details-dialog.tsx`
- Replaced separate service/product transaction creation with consolidated approach
- Updated `recordAppointmentTransaction()` function to use `ConsolidatedTransactionService`
- Maintains discount logic (services only)

### 5. Updated Booking Summary Transaction Recording
- **File**: `components/scheduling/enhanced-booking-summary.tsx`
- Added consolidated transaction recording in `handlePaymentComplete()`
- Integrated with existing payment flow
- Preserves discount functionality

### 6. Enhanced Accounting Page Display
- **File**: `components/accounting/transactions.tsx`
- Updated transaction table to show consolidated transaction details
- Enhanced description column to display itemized breakdown
- Enhanced amount column to show service/product breakdown
- Added discount information display

### 7. Improved Transaction Details Dialog
- **File**: `components/accounting/transaction-details-dialog.tsx`
- Enhanced to display consolidated transaction information
- Shows itemized breakdown with service/product badges
- Displays discount information per item
- Added consolidated transaction summary section

### 8. Updated Appointments Page
- **File**: `app/dashboard/appointments/page.tsx`
- Replaced old transaction recording logic with consolidated approach
- Simplified transaction creation process

## How It Works

### Transaction Creation Flow
1. **Payment Initiated**: User completes payment for appointment/booking
2. **Consolidated Transaction Generated**: System creates single transaction with unique ID
3. **Items Processed**: 
   - Services: Discount applied if specified
   - Products: Always at full price (no discount)
4. **Transaction Stored**: Single record saved with all items and breakdown
5. **Display Updated**: Accounting page shows consolidated view

### Discount Logic
- **Services**: Discount percentage applied to all services
- **Products**: No discount applied (sold at full price)
- **Calculation**: 
  - `serviceAmount` = original service total - discount amount
  - `productAmount` = original product total (unchanged)
  - `totalAmount` = serviceAmount + productAmount

### Transaction Types
- **consolidated_sale**: When both services and products are present
- **service_sale**: When only services are present
- **product_sale**: When only products are present

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Create Test Appointment
1. Go to Appointments page
2. Create appointment with:
   - Main service (e.g., "Hair Cut" - 100 QAR)
   - Additional services (e.g., "Hair Wash" - 25 QAR)
   - Products (e.g., "Shampoo" - 30 QAR)

### 2. Complete Payment with Discount
1. Mark appointment as completed
2. In payment dialog, apply 20% discount
3. Complete payment
4. Verify success message

### 3. Verify Accounting Display
1. Go to Accounting page
2. Check that only ONE transaction appears for the payment
3. Verify transaction shows:
   - Type: "consolidated_sale"
   - Correct total amount
   - Service/product breakdown in description
   - Discount information

### 4. Check Transaction Details
1. Click "View details" on the transaction
2. Verify detailed breakdown shows:
   - Individual items with service/product badges
   - Discount applied only to services
   - Products at full price
   - Consolidated summary section

## Expected Results

### Before (Old System)
- Two separate transactions: TX-[timestamp]-service and TX-[timestamp]-product
- Separate transaction IDs
- Discount logic unclear in accounting view

### After (New System)
- One consolidated transaction: TX-CONS-[timestamp]-[random]
- Single transaction ID per payment session
- Clear service/product breakdown
- Discount logic clearly displayed
- Better accounting visibility

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Accounting**: One transaction per payment session
2. **Clear Breakdown**: Services and products clearly separated
3. **Discount Transparency**: Discount application clearly shown
4. **Better Reporting**: Easier to track complete payment sessions
5. **Improved UX**: Cleaner accounting interface
6. **Data Integrity**: Maintains referential integrity with single transaction per payment

## Files Modified
- `lib/transaction-types.ts`
- `lib/consolidated-transaction-service.ts` (new)
- `prisma/schema.prisma`
- `components/scheduling/enhanced-appointment-details-dialog.tsx`
- `components/scheduling/enhanced-booking-summary.tsx`
- `components/accounting/transactions.tsx`
- `components/accounting/transaction-details-dialog.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/appointments/page.tsx`

## Backward Compatibility
The system maintains backward compatibility with existing transactions while new payments use the consolidated approach.
