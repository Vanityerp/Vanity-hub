## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Relationships

```sql
-- Service-Location Relationships
CREATE TABLE location_services (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  locationId TEXT NOT NULL,
  serviceId TEXT NOT NULL,
  price DECIMAL,
  isActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (locationId) REFERENCES locations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (serviceId) REFERENCES services(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  UNIQUE(locationId, serviceId)
);

-- Staff-Location Assignments
CREATE TABLE staff_locations (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  staffId TEXT NOT NULL,
  locationId TEXT NOT NULL,
  isActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (staffId) REFERENCES staff_members(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  FOREIGN KEY (locationId) REFERENCES locations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  UNIQUE(staffId, locationId)
);
```

### API Endpoints

#### Service Management
- `GET /api/services` - Fetch services with location filtering
- `POST /api/services` - Create service with auto-location assignment
- `PUT /api/services/[id]` - Update service with location management
- `DELETE /api/services/[id]` - Delete service with relationship cleanup

#### Staff Management
- `GET /api/staff` - Fetch staff with location filtering
- `POST /api/staff` - Create staff with auto-location assignment
- `PUT /api/staff/[id]` - Update staff with location management
- `DELETE /api/staff/[id]` - Delete staff with relationship cleanup

#### Location Sync
- `GET /api/sync-service-locations` - Get service-location statistics
- `POST /api/sync-service-locations` - Sync service-location relationships
- `GET /api/sync-staff-locations` - Get staff-location statistics
- `POST /api/sync-staff-locations` - Sync staff-location assignments

### UI Components

#### Enhanced Components
- `ServicesList` - Added location filtering and display
- `StaffDirectory` - Added location filtering and assignment display
- `NewServiceDialog` - Enhanced with location selection
- `EditServiceDialog` - Enhanced with location management
- `EditStaffDialog` - Enhanced with location assignment

#### New Components

- `LocationSelector` - Reusable location filter component

## Data Flow

### Service Creation Flow
1. User creates new service
2. All active locations pre-selected by default
3. User can modify location selection
4. API creates service record
5. API creates LocationService relationships
6. UI updates with new service and locations

### Staff Assignment Flow
1. User creates new staff member
2. All active locations assigned by default
3. User can modify location assignments
4. API creates staff record
5. API creates StaffLocation relationships
6. UI updates with new staff and assignments

### Sync Operations Flow
