# Client Portal to Accounting Sync Implementation

## Overview
This implementation ensures that appointments booked through the client portal automatically appear in the accounting page daily sales section when they are completed.

## Problem Solved
Previously, client portal appointments were not showing up in the accounting page transactions, making it difficult to track revenue from online bookings.

## Solution Architecture

### 1. **Client Portal Transaction Sync Service**
**File:** `lib/client-portal-transaction-sync.ts`

**Key Features:**
- Automatically converts completed client portal appointments to accounting transactions
- Prevents duplicate transaction creation with sync tracking
- Uses the existing `ConsolidatedTransactionService` for consistency
- Properly attributes transactions to `CLIENT_PORTAL` source

**Main Functions:**
```typescript
// Sync completed client portal appointments to transactions
ClientPortalTransactionSync.syncClientPortalAppointments(addTransaction)

// Mark appointment as synced to prevent duplicates
ClientPortalTransactionSync.markAppointmentAsSynced(appointmentId)

// Check if appointment is already synced
ClientPortalTransactionSync.isAppointmentSynced(appointmentId)
```

### 2. **Transaction Provider Integration**
**File:** `lib/transaction-provider.tsx`

**Enhancements:**
- Added automatic sync on provider initialization
- Added manual sync function for testing/troubleshooting
- Integrated with existing transaction management system

**New Context Function:**
```typescript
const { syncClientPortalAppointments } = useTransactions();
```

### 3. **Appointment Source Attribution**
**File:** `app/api/client-portal/appointments/route.ts`

**Already Implemented:**
```typescript
const newAppointment = {
  // ... other fields
  source: 'client_portal',
  bookedVia: 'client_portal',
  metadata: {
    source: 'client_portal',
    bookedVia: 'client_portal',
    isClientPortalBooking: true
  }
};
```

## How It Works

### 1. **Appointment Creation Flow**
```
Client Portal Booking → API Creates Appointment → Stored with client_portal source
```

### 2. **Transaction Sync Flow**
```
Transaction Provider Loads → Auto Sync Runs → Finds Completed Client Portal Appointments → Creates Transactions → Marks as Synced
```

### 3. **Accounting Display Flow**
```
Accounting Page Loads → Transaction Provider Provides Data → Client Portal Transactions Displayed with Correct Source
```

## Sync Criteria

An appointment is synced to a transaction if:
- ✅ `appointment.source === 'client_portal'` OR
- ✅ `appointment.bookedVia === 'client_portal'` OR  
- ✅ `appointment.metadata?.source === 'client_portal'` OR
- ✅ `appointment.metadata?.isClientPortalBooking === true`
- ✅ `appointment.status === 'completed'`
- ✅ `appointment.metadata?.transactionSynced !== true` (not already synced)

## Transaction Properties

Synced transactions have these properties:
```typescript
{
  id: "CP-XXXXXX", // Client Portal prefix
  source: TransactionSource.CLIENT_PORTAL,
  clientName: appointment.clientName,
  amount: appointment.price,
  paymentMethod: PaymentMethod.CREDIT_CARD, // Default
  status: TransactionStatus.COMPLETED,
  reference: {
    type: "appointment",
    id: appointment.id
  },
  metadata: {
    syncedFromClientPortal: true,
    originalAppointmentId: appointment.id,
    syncTimestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Testing

### 1. **Automated Test Script**
**File:** `test-client-portal-sync.js`

**Usage:**
```javascript
// In browser console
testClientPortalSync(); // Creates test data and runs sync
cleanupTestData(); // Removes test data
```

### 2. **Manual Testing Steps**

#### **Step 1: Create Client Portal Appointment**
1. Go to client portal booking page
2. Complete a booking (any service/staff/time)
3. Note the booking reference number

#### **Step 2: Complete the Appointment**
1. Go to dashboard appointments page
2. Find the client portal appointment (look for "Client Portal" badge)
3. Change status to "Completed"

#### **Step 3: Verify in Accounting**
1. Go to dashboard/accounting
2. Select "Daily Sales" tab
3. Look for the appointment in the transactions list
4. Should show source as "Client Portal"

#### **Step 4: Manual Sync (if needed)**
```javascript
// In browser console
const { syncClientPortalAppointments } = useTransactions();
const syncedCount = syncClientPortalAppointments();
console.log(`Synced ${syncedCount} appointments`);
```

## Troubleshooting

### **Appointments Not Appearing in Accounting**

1. **Check Appointment Status**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   const appointments = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vanity_appointments') || '[]');
   const clientPortalAppts = appointments.filter(a => a.source === 'client_portal');
   console.log('Client Portal Appointments:', clientPortalAppts);
   ```

2. **Check Sync Status**
   ```javascript
   // Check if appointments are marked as synced
   clientPortalAppts.forEach(apt => {
     console.log(`${apt.id}: Status=${apt.status}, Synced=${apt.metadata?.transactionSynced}`);
   });
   ```

3. **Manual Sync**
   ```javascript
   const { syncClientPortalAppointments } = useTransactions();
   syncClientPortalAppointments();
   ```

4. **Check Transactions**
   ```javascript
   const transactions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('vanity_transactions') || '[]');
   const clientPortalTxns = transactions.filter(tx => tx.source === 'CLIENT_PORTAL');
   console.log('Client Portal Transactions:', clientPortalTxns);
   ```

### **Common Issues**

#### **Issue: Duplicate Transactions**
**Solution:** The sync service includes duplicate prevention. If duplicates occur:
```javascript
const { cleanupAllDuplicates } = useTransactions();
cleanupAllDuplicates();
```

#### **Issue: Wrong Transaction Source**
**Solution:** Verify appointment has correct metadata:
```javascript
// Appointment should have:
appointment.source === 'client_portal'
appointment.metadata?.isClientPortalBooking === true
```

#### **Issue: Sync Not Running**
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors and manually trigger:
```javascript
const { syncClientPortalAppointments } = useTransactions();
syncClientPortalAppointments();
```

## Benefits
