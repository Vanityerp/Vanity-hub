## Technical Details

  id: string
  name: string
  email: string
  role: string
  status: string
  locations: string[]
}

interface EditUserFormProps {

  onCancel: () => void
  isSubmitting?: boolean
}
```

### Role Options:

- **receptionist**: Staff

### API Integration:
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/staff/{userId}`
- **Payload**: User data with role, status, and location updates
- **Response**: Success/error handling with toast notifications

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Login:
1. Go to login page
2. Use demo credentials:
   - Email: `admin@vanityhub.com`
   - Password: `admin123`
3. Should successfully log in

### 2. Test User Settings:
1. Navigate to Settings page
2. Click "Edit" on any user
3. Change the role (e.g., from Staff to Manager)
4. Update location assignments
5. Click "Save Changes"
6. Should see success toast and changes should persist

## Troubleshooting

### If Login Still Fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database is running
3. Check NextAuth configuration
4. Try running the login fix script again

### If Role Editing Still Doesn't Work:
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify the staff API endpoint exists
3. Check network tab for failed requests
4. Ensure proper authentication

### Common Issues:
- **Database Connection**: Ensure database is running and accessible
- **API Endpoints**: Verify `/api/staff/{id}` endpoint exists and works
- **Authentication**: Make sure user is properly authenticated
- **Permissions**: Check if user has permission to edit other users
