## Updated Components

### Core Data Providers
- `lib/service-provider.tsx` - Uses `ServiceStorage`
- `lib/staff-provider.tsx` - Uses `StaffDataService`
- `lib/client-provider.tsx` - Uses `ClientDataService`

### Application Pages
- `app/dashboard/appointments/page.tsx` - Uses `ServiceStorage` instead of `mockServices`

### Initialization
- `components/data-initializer.tsx` - Uses `DataMigrationService`
- `lib/data-initialization.ts` - Updated to use new data services

## Data Persistence Strategy

### Storage Keys
- `vanity_services` - Services data
- `vanity_service_categories` - Service categories
- `vanity_staff` - Staff members
- `vanity_clients` - Client information
- `vanity_appointments` - Appointment data
- `vanity_transactions` - Transaction records
- `vanity_migration_status` - Migration tracking

### Data Relationships Maintained
- ✅ Appointments linked to clients (clientId)
- ✅ Appointments linked to staff (staffId)
- ✅ Appointments linked to services (service name)
- ✅ Transactions linked to appointments (reference.id)
- ✅ Staff linked to locations (locations array)
- ✅ Services linked to locations (locations array)

## Currency Integration

### Features Implemented
- Consistent currency display across all components
- Real-time currency change updates
- CSS custom properties for styling
- Currency validation and formatting utilities
- Event-driven currency updates

### Components Enhanced
- `CurrencyDisplay` - Already robust, maintained compatibility
- `CurrencyIntegration` - New global currency management
- All monetary displays automatically update with currency changes

## Migration Process

### Automatic Migration
1. **Detection**: System checks if migration is needed on startup
2. **Services**: Initializes services and categories
3. **Staff**: Initializes staff members with roles and locations
4. **Clients**: Initializes clients with segments and preferences
5. **Locations**: Ensures location data is available
6. **Verification**: Confirms data integrity after migration

### Migration Status Tracking
- Each migration step is tracked individually
- Prevents duplicate migrations
- Allows for incremental updates
- Provides rollback capabilities

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Data Persistence ✅
- All data survives page refreshes and browser sessions
- No more loss of user-created data
- Consistent data state across application

### 2. Scalability ✅
- Easy to add new services, staff, and clients
- CRUD operations for all data types
- Proper data relationships maintained

### 3. Performance ✅
- Efficient localStorage usage
- Data caching where appropriate
- Minimal memory footprint

### 4. Maintainability ✅
- Clean separation of concerns
- Centralized data services
- Consistent API patterns

### 5. User Experience ✅
- Preserved all existing UI layouts
- Maintained appointment calendar functionality
- Smooth transition without breaking changes
- Consistent currency display

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Data Persistence Test
```javascript
// Create new service, refresh page, verify it persists
// Create new staff member, refresh page, verify it persists
// Create new client, refresh page, verify it persists
```

### 2. Currency Integration Test
```javascript
// Change currency in settings
// Verify all prices update immediately
// Verify currency symbol changes globally
```

### 3. Migration Test
```javascript
// Clear localStorage
// Refresh application
// Verify all default data is initialized
// Verify migration status is tracked
```

### 4. Relationship Integrity Test
```javascript
// Create appointment with specific staff and service
// Verify staff and service data is correctly linked
// Complete appointment and verify transaction is created
```

## Future Enhancements
